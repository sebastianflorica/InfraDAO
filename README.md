# InfraDAO
Tokenization of RWA's through Infrustructure Project and Funding

**InfraDAO** is an innovative solution to democratize infrastructure funding. Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) harnesses blockchain technology to tokenize infrastructure development projects, both private and public. This enables a new generation of investors to partake in vital infrastructure development by purchasing tokens representing shares in these projects.

Once a project is submitted to InfraDAO, it undergoes a thorough community-led vetting process. If approved via a majority vote, the project is tokenized and the ERC20 tokens are put up for sale, thus raising capital for the project's development.

Investors aren't just buying tokens; they're buying into the future of infrastructure and the potential for solid returns. As a token holder, you can trade your tokens on the open market or hold onto them and receive revenue based on the projectâ€™s stipulations. For example, for a residential property development, you would receive a share of profits from the sale of the units upon project completion.

InfraDAO revolutionizes how infrastructure development is funded, fostering greater transparency, access, and community engagement. With InfraDAO, everyone can play a part in shaping our built environment, contributing to projects they believe in and sharing in their success.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up InfraDAO on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Installing

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/IKalonji/InfraDAO.git
2. Install NPM packages
3. Run NPM: npm run start

## Project Flow (Mermaid Diagram)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Member] --> B[DAO Contract]
    B --> C{Vote on Project}
    C -->|Yes| D[Project Submission Contract]
    D --> E[Tokenization Contract]
    E --> F[Buy Tokens]
    A --> F
    E --> G[Trading Contract]
    A --> G
    D --> H[Revenue Distribution Contract]
    H --> I[Receive Revenue]
    A --> I
```

In this diagram:

* Members interact with the DAO Contract to vote on projects.
* If a project is approved, it goes through the Project Submission Contract and then to the Tokenization Contract.
* Members can then buy tokens directly or trade them through the Trading Contract.
* Finally, the Revenue Distribution Contract allows members to receive their share of the project's revenue.
